```

  

## Setting up the Server

  

To use the real-time chat application, you need to first run `server.py` by opening a command prompt and navigating to the file location. Type the following command:

  

```sh

python  server.py

```

  

Alternatively, you can use any IDE of your choice.

  

## How to Use the Application

  

To use the application, run `client.py` using the same methods as before. Note that you must set up the server first for this to work properly. After opening `client.py`, proceed to set up where you must enter your username. After that, you will be connected to the server, and you can now chat with others and have fun!

  

You can run as many instances of `client.py` as you want.
